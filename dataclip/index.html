<h1>Mobile Camera AI Sensors with Privacy Protection</h1>

Presenter: Loren K Heyns<br>
Course: Georgia Tech, Computer Applications for Construction, CEE 6110<br><br>

Opportunities to use mobile cameras to contribute data to real-time models for use in construction, urban planning and predictive models are virtually untapped due to privacy concerns and information silos.

Through the use of de-identified data can be aggregated and shared without sacrificing privacy.<br><br>

<h1>A Brief History of Wearable Cameras</h1>


    <h2><!--A Brief History of -->Public-Facing Mobile Sensors</h2>

    <p>Most mobile sensors worn by individuals track their own biometrics. For example, FitBit records walking and heart-rate. The typical mobile sensor doesn't record data from the people and locations around you. In contrast, the following sensors are designed to capture information from your surrounding environment, hands-free.</p><br>

    <p><b>Narrative Clip 2012 to 2016 - Consumer focused "Life-Logging" Camera</b></p>

    <div style="float:right; margin-left:60px"><img src="../img/dataclip/narrative-white-clip2-necklace.jpg" style="width:100%; max-width: 250px"></div>

    <p>
    The Narrative Clip was initiated in 2012 by a $500,000 kickstarter campaign. The small "life-logging" camera automatically took a picture every 30 seconds.
    Narrative shipped 40,000 units of the Narrative 1 and 2 combined.[2]&nbsp; When the company could not attract further financing in 2016, only pre-ordered Narrative 2 units were delivered. The Narrative Clip 2 was packed with new features: video capture, Bluetooth control, a built-in Wifi cloud uploader and modular attachment system.]<br><br>

    At the peak of it's potential, why was the Narrative Clip unable to move forward?
       Narrative's CTO stated that the cashflow problems in 2016 were due to a decline in venture capital for wearables. 

      The assets were acquired by some of the former founders and employees, who are now preparing for a relaunch. [3]

      <!--
       There have been rumours of a Narrative Clip 3 being developed by the new company but no official announcements have been made." - <a href="https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Narrative_Clip">Wikipedia</a> (Primary sources to be added.)
      -->
    </p>


    <div style="overflow: auto">
      <p>
      Narrative Clip updates planned for the relaunch:<br>
      - Shift from sole focus on consumer to business applications<br>
      - Adding revenue generation from cloud storage<br>
      - New manufacturing partners<br>
      </p>      
    </div>

    <p>
        Narrative's loss of funding in 2016 may have been partially related to the public privacy outcry surrounding the privacy infringements of Google Glass cameras in restaurants and bars.</p>

        <b>Google Glass - 2014 to 2015, Google Glass Enterprise Edition - 2017</b>
        Today Google Glasses have expanded their market within manufacturing, where handsfree training is needed on the factory floor. Narrative may have also been a less appealing investment with emerging competition from simlar clip devices, like the Ion Clip Camera below. Perhaps a rethink of privacy notification and protection is needed before wearing data sensors in public becomes common.<br><br>

        Glass competitor Looxcie shifted from consumer to business products in 2014 under their 
          enterprise-focused service <a href="http://www.vidcie.com/">Vidcie</a>.

<h1>The Market for Mobile Sensors</h1>




  


    <p style="font-size:20px">
        AI cameras could replace the use of RFID and Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) tags by using camera images to identify all supplies, vehicles and workers on the construction site. AI can track minor difference on objects to establish uniqueness.
        <!--
      With a wide range of sensor technogy being combined in novel ways for 
      new forms of mobile sensor devices, the construction industry has a large set of device categories to draw from.
    -->
    </p>

<p><a href="../img/dataclip/wearable-sensors-7C.jpg"><img src="../img/dataclip/wearable-sensors-7C.jpg" style="width:100%; max-width: 750px; floatX:right"></a></p>

    <p>
      The $5bn sensor market in 2018 is anticipated to grow into a $160bn wearable technology market in ten years. Across 42 different categories of wearable devices, optical sensors are anticipated to hold the largest share of the wearable market in 2022. The second largest percentage is three-dimensional inertial measurement units (IMU) tracking force and angular rate measurement units using accelerometers and gyroscopes, often accompanied by magnetometers to provide additional directional data.</p>

    <h2>Mobile Data Collection for Smart City Infrastructure Models</h2>

    <p>
      Beyond the realm of construction sites, the entire city looms as a prospective 
      source of infrastructure sensor data for Digital Twins modeling on an urban scale. (Mohammadi, Taylor 2016)&nbsp;

      <!-- for predicting and improving urban outcomes -->
       As mobile sensors capture data from many vantage points to make predictive models more accurate, we'll need to ensure that we don't sacrifice privacy for safety and extreme accuracy.  For example, an array of construction cameras sharing real-time 3D spatial data with all the contractors on the site could significantly increase safety.  Without a means to filter out people passing by from shared videos, construction firms could be revealing the whereabouts of thousands of people to their contractors, making the public walking by the site vulnerable to home break-ins, blackmail or embarrassment if videos are posted online.

    <h1>Privacy Protection Indicator Colors</h1>

    <p>How can we indicate the type of data capture underway, so nearby individuals 
    are aware of the degree to which their actions are recorded? 

    Google Clips use "white" to indicate intermittent video recording. 
    Continual unfiltered recording could be "red", the current standard for video recording.<br><br>


    "Green" and "blue" could be safe colors indicating that privacy is being protected.

    
    </p>

    <!--
    <p>
    indicator color could be expanded to include more colors for other types of recording.

    At the most basic level, generic data recording (green) would be air quality, humidity and temperature, general counts of people, sound level, etc. At the highest level, another color simultaneous to green, would indicate de-identification of facial features, removing text and audio snippets to protect identity.

Oculus founder Palmer Luckie's new company Anduril uses AI cameras with 600-watt lasers which were originally developed for cosmetic hair-removal devices. Apple's TrueDepth Camera on the 2018 iPhone X uses an infrared (IR) emitter to projects over 30,000 dots onto the user's face, which are analysed by a lower power infrared camera yet to be duplicated by other vendors. (Intel RealSense has yet to succeed at smooth infrared spatial 3D capture.)

<h1>The Future of Mobile AI cameras - Private and Secure</h1>

    <p>A new breed of AI cameras could focus on assembling anonymous datasets from multiple perspectives to provide ongoing updates to 3D city models. Data captured could include temperature, noise levels, air quality, etc. 

    To achieve this goal, AI could remove personal identifiers before sharing data. Example:

    </p>


    <img src="../img/dataclip/face-de-identification.png" style="width:100%; max-width:500px;"><br><br>
      <p>

        The images in the top row were de-identified to produce each image below. Each has a similar face structure to the one above to avoid leaving holes in the source image. Most prior de-identification systems used the k-same framework, which is critiqued as less effective with poor quality. The new PrivacyProtective-GAN (PP-GAN) framework retains "structure similarity." (Yifan, Yang, Ling, 2018)
        
      The same Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) process is used to alter faces within video. (Carnegie Mellon University, 2018)
      </p>


    <p>
      Individuals could have the option to access personal data related to themselves and members of their data sharing groups using Privacy-Preserving Face Recognition. (Erkin 2009)&nbsp;<!--  independent of government and private organizations. -->
    
    A committee of peers with multiple decryption keys could decrypt additional data in the event of a crime. 

    <!--
    &nbsp; The shared city data model would generate crowds and traffic 
      approximating the quanities in the original video and 3D spatial photography.--><br>
    </p>


      <p>
      <b>Anonymous Confidentiality Scale</b> - Conveys the probability of protecting identities with the current data capture settings.
      Clearing data of personal identifiers is rarely 100% guaranteed.
      </p>

      <!--
      <p>
      Anon Text to Full Text - 0 to 100<br>
      Anon Audio to Full Audio - 0 to 100<br>
      Anon Video to Full Video - 0 to 100<br>
      Anon Spatial to Full Spatial - 0 to 100<br>
      Anon Object to Full Object - 0 to 100<br>
      </p>
      -->

       <p>
        The more pieces of information occurring together, the harder it is to clear the data of identifiers. Information that increases likely identification of people includes: physical characteristics, height, age and gender, memberships, job type, length of service and expressed opinions. 
      </p>

      <!--

       Individual Identity Scale - 0 to 100<br>
       Animal Identity Scale - 0 to 100<br>
     </p>
      -->

    <h1>Local Identity "Reidentification" vs. Universal Facial Recognition</h1>

    
    <p>Identity "Reidentification" is used by building and event security systems to track individuals 
    as they move across a site.</p>

    <p>Google Clips store data only on the camera, where it's fully encrypted. 
    Google Lens identifies everything from plants to pets, but not people.
    When Google Lens enables human identification, will it be limited to one's immediate friends, coworkers, fellow students?
    </p>

    <p>Identity reidentification seeks to find matches despite different poses, illumination, scales, occlusions, makeup and environmental variations. No existing face data is needed at the start, unlike facial recognition which requires massive datasets. This study uses the ResFace learning algorithm as the last step in a Deep Neural Network (DNN) pipeline to pull from 200,000+ faces on security cameras. Computation occurs in parallel on cameras.

    <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
        <p>AI cameras provide an opportunity for organizations and individuals to monitor and improve safety, productivity, quality, scheduling and related data analytics. Sharing data with surrounding systems will greatly increase the 
        impact and cost savings for all data contributors by removing redundancy while adding resiliency and accuracy through data captured from multiple vantage points.</p>

      <p>AI cameras with spatial capabilities that update 3D models in real-time 
        have the potential to transform industries from construction to healthcare. 
        AI cameras have the potential to update BIM data to adjust calendars automatically 
        for deliveries and contractor schedules as project managers work with predictive 
        3D models to preview workflow projections as they watch for anomalies while training AI.
      </p>

    <p>
        Through the use of de-identification, AI cameras can be used to contribute data to real-time city models without sacrificing privacy and security. 
        With anonymous retrieval standards, facial recognition services by Apple, Facebook, Google, Amazon and Microsoft [9,10] can be used to securely identify individuals prior to de-identification so they can be provided with encrypted copies of photos and videos of themselves taken by others. Under special circumstances, a group of peers could be granted permission to unlock additional data for solving crimes.
